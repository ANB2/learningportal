# learningportal

A Couchbase / Elastic Search proof of concept app.

## Dependencies

### Stable

The following dependencies are considered stable and working as a minimum version. 

* elastic search **0.19.3**
* Ruby **1.9.3-p0**
* Bundler **1.1.4**

### Development

The following dependencies are currently in development and may change more frequently.

* libcouchbase **1.1.0.dp5**
* couchbase server **2.0.dp4.1** (version 730)

## Installation

### Development (OSX)

The first thing to do is ensure your OSX machine is ready to go.

1. [OSX Ruby Development Dependencies](learningportal/tree/master/doc/dependencies.base.md)
2. [Application Dependencies](learningportal/tree/master/doc/dependencies.application.md)

Once you've done that, for local development we have two approaches

* [Standard Development Environment](learningportal/tree/master/doc/development.standard.md)
* [Development Environment with a Couchbase VM using Vagrant](learningportal/tree/master/doc/development.vagrant.md)

The benefit of a VM is such that new development releases of couchbase server can be tested (and isolated) from the learningportal app.


## Management Tasks

The following is a list of tasks that are useful for managing the application.

    âžœ  learningportal git:(master) rake -T | grep lp:
    rake lp:create              # Create all buckets
    rake lp:drop                # Drop all buckets
    rake lp:migrate             # Update couchbase views
    rake lp:recalculate_active  # Recalculate active content
    rake lp:recalculate_scores  # Schedule background score indexing for all documents
    rake lp:reindex             # Regenerate all indexes
    rake lp:reset               # Reset all data (create, drop, migrate, seed)
    rake lp:seed                # Seed 100 documents
    rake lp:top_tags_authors    # Update top tags and authors
